Lilium’s new funding came with a post-money valuation of more than a billion dollars, a person familiar with the situation told Bloomberg.\\n\\n4) The European Union’s antitrust watchdog is planning to file charges against Amazon over its treatment of third-party sellers, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.  The charges could come as early as next week or the week after and would focus on Amazon’s dual role as both a seller and operator of the marketplace, according to the Journal.\\n\\n5) Meanwhile, the UK’s watchdog on Friday announced that it has launched an investigation into Facebook’s (reportedly for $400 million) acquisition of Giphy, the popular GIF repository and search engine.\\n\\n6) Trustly, a startup from Sweden that has built a platform to make it as easy for merchants to accept bank transfers as it is to take card payments to complete online transactions, has raised ‘a significant round’ of funding from a group of investors led by BlackRock at a +$1 billion valuation.\\n\\n7) Belgian fintech startup Silverfin has raised a Series B round of $30 million, according to De Tijd.

According to lawyers for Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati who argued the case for Forescout, the agreement marks the first \"material adverse event\" related to Covid-19 where a temporary restraining order was granted and a settlement was reached. Advent had announced in May that it wanted to back out of the sale as a result of the effect that the pandemic had on Forescout's security device business. In response, Forescout sued Advent in Delaware Chancery Court, arguing that the purchase agreement specifically barred Advent from citing the coronavirus as creating a material adverse change that would excuse the investment fund from finalizing the deal. The trial had been scheduled to start July 20. The transaction is now expected to close in the third quarter. Crosspoint Capital Partners, Morgan Stanley and Ropes &amp; Gray also advised on the deal.\\n\\nGuiding portfolio companies through the Covid-19 pandemic is the biggest challenge facing private equity firms and service providers today. Firms throughout the middle market are focused now on helping portfolio companies make decisions about reopening their businesses, assessing the impact of the coronavirus on their businesses and forging a strategy on moving forward. For example, Boston-based Watermill worked with portfolio company Enbi to reimagine its business to make face shields. \"They are a high-tech company with deep market knowhow that make rollers for printers,\" says Julia Karol, president and COO of Watermill. \"The company realized people who have to wear the face shields for long periods of time were getting deep welts on their foreheads. Enbi was able to make a high-grade compound that used foam across the front of the shields, so they are comfortable. Enbi will continue to make masks and explore other innovations. It's awesome to see the whole manufacturing community using their skills and expertise to help.\" For more insights from Watermill, New Heritage, Monroe, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and EisnerAmper, see the story Switching gears: 5 ways private equity firms and service providers are helping portfolio companies adapt in the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nDEAL NEWS\\n\\nLast year Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, was set to buy a 20 percent stake in Reliance Industries Ltd.'s refining and petrochemicals business, valuing it at $75 billion.

But looking out 24 months, respondents are overwhelmingly positive about the U.S. economic outlook, reports Dykema and the Association for Corporate Growth -- Detroit, San Antonio/Austin and Columbus Chapters, which conducted the survey. The survey respondents also say that the No. 1 driver of U.S. M&amp;A deal activity is the health of the U.S. economy, and most believe their company or portfolio companies will be involved in an M&amp;A transaction in the next 12 months.\\n\\nAfter a three-month decline that brought U.S. manufacturing activity to its lowest level since the global financial crisis, the industry showed signs of slight recovery in May and June, according to Capstone Headwaters' Industrials &amp; Manufacturing Update. Capstone reported that from speaking to industry players and private equity firms about how Covid-19 has impacted their business model and merger and acquisition appetite, the firm has found that while activity has slowed, select M&amp;A transactions are still underway.\\n\\nWilliam Blair has added two senior investment bankers: Jamie Hamilton as managing director, financial technology investment banking, and B.T. Remmert as managing director, IT services investment banking, both in Atlanta.\\n\\nEQUALITY AND INCLUSION\\n\\nA 2019 report from the Institute for Policy Studies shows that the median wealth for Black families in 2016 was $3,557 -- about 2% of the median wealth owned by white families, which owned nearly $147,000 in the same year. For banks to play a major role in closing the income gap between whites and Blacks, they'll need to diversify their top leadership and middle-management ranks. New hiring and promotional policies could reshape banks' understanding of local communities' needs and expand who gets mortgages or small-business loans and which families build lasting wealth. Including more people of color in bank management would diversify the flow of capital, says Malia Lazu, the chief experience and culture officer at Berkshire Hills Bancorp in Boston.

In addition to Pendleton, the firm's leaders are: Noramay Cadena, co-founder and managing partner of MiLA Capital; Daphne Dufresne, a managing partner of GenNx 360 Capital Partners; Juliana Garaizar, an angel investor; and Karen Kerr, executive managing director at GE Ventures. \"We believe that strength lies in differences and seek out entrepreneurs and startups who are using shifting demographics and their own diversity of experience and thought to create innovation that offers outsized opportunities for returns and impact.\" The fund had its first close earlier in 2020 and has made two investments to date: The first investment is in MoCaFi, a fintech startup founded by Wole Coaxum, a former JPMorgan Chase commercial banking executive and entrepreneur, who is African American. \"MoCaFi offers a mobile-first banking platform that brings digital banking products to underbanked or unbanked communities (an 88 million U.S. market), allowing them to build credit and financial mobility,\" Pendleton explains.

In today's environment in which the stakes have been raised by the coronavirus crisis, professional help from service providers is more important than ever. Private equity firms and their portfolio companies want to know what actions they can or should take, and what their peers are considering, to make the best decisions possible in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Through talking with many different affected parties, service providers have streams of data and information that can help investors make informed decisions and minimize negative economic impacts on their investments. Mergers &amp; Acquisitions examines offerings from EHE Health, Norgay Partners, Cepres, Valuation Research Corp. and Axial. \"The stakes are high today,\" says Greg Mansur, chief client officer at EHE Health, which provides a playbook on getting companies back to work safely. \"We want to be part of the solution for our clients.

Supplemental due diligence is not only prudent -- it is likely to be required as a condition to the placement of any representations and warranties insurance. Essential considerations include whether the target has been able to innovate and whether the valuation agreed to in a letter of intent should be revisited. Buyers should also review any termination provisions to determine whether any breakup fee would be payable.

See the full story: How analytics can rebalance M&amp;A in the wake of the coronavirus.\\n\\nArizent, the parent company of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, released a new survey May 15 to understand how executives across industries were dealing with the impacts of the Covid-19 crisis after operating in a \"new normal\" environment for two months. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to extend its grip on the globe -- infecting more than 1.41 million Americans (over 4.44 million globally) by the middle of May -- executives must navigate their organizations through uncharted territory, with the possibility that the virus may not disappear any time soon. This is forcing C-suites to make big, lasting decisions with few guideposts to aid them. The April survey found that there was a surprisingly smooth, albeit hurried transition to remote, with most companies, including private equity firms and investment banks, feeling that they performed on par or above their own expectations. However, technology gaps did arise, as some companies found that customers either didn't have the equipment to access their accounts digitally or needed training from staff working remotely. In the middle market, dealmakers report that \"opportunities have thinned somewhat but have not disappeared,\" as one private equity investor put it. \"Investor base still has liquidity to invest.\" Said one investment banker focused on real estate: \"Pending deals were either put on hold, cancelled or delayed. Asset prices for listings are being re-evaluated or renegotiated with the sellers and buyers expecting discounts.\" For more, see: Exclusive survey: How private equity firms, investment banks and other companies are surviving the pandemic.\\n\\nWhat do you do when you're a dealmaker under quarantine, and face-to-face meetings are out of the question? For Work from Home (WFH) strategies, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions turns to eight prominent dealmakers from private equity firms, investment banks, lenders and law firms. \"I miss the excitement of a great conference; wearing my nice clothes, early morning breakfasts, the one-on-ones, drinks with my women 'tribe,' and dinner at a steakhouse, even though I am a vegan,\" says Amy Weisman, managing director, business development, Sterling Investment Partners. In some respects, it is easier to build relationships now, explains Nanette Heide, partner, co-chair, private equity group, Duane Morris. \"Meeting folks over a video conference from their home is immediately humanizing.\" M&amp;A pros also point out that human factors play a role. \"Emotional Quotient (EQ) is more important than ever during trying times,\" says Jeremy Holland, managing partner, origination, The Riverside Co. \"It's critical to remember that the dealmaker on other side of the (now figurative) deal table is a person, too. They have good and bad days and presumably know many people in high-risk categories, potentially even themselves. Being extra thoughtful about each interaction is important.\" Read our full coverage: Dealmaking under quarantine: 8 private equity and M&amp;A pros share strategies while social distancing.\\n\\nMORE FEATURED CONTENT\\n\\nMergers &amp; Acquisitions is recognizing nine dealmakers as the 2020 Rising Stars of Private Equity:\\n\\nThese outstanding up-and-coming investment professionals have been excelling during a period of profound change in the U.S. and in the world. The publication of this list comes at a pivotal moment in time. The country is beginning to open up after three months of quarantine from the coronavirus, while a second wave picks up steam in the Sun Belt from South Carolina to California and including Texas. Dealmaking under quarantine while working from home has proved challenging, to say the least.\\n\\nSocial justice issues have taken on fresh urgency. There is heightened awareness of systemic racial injustice and police brutality against Blacks after the deaths of George Floyd and many others. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled recently that, \"An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.\" On immigration policy, the Court recently put the brakes on dismantling the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Meanwhile, the President is asking the Court to overturn the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\\n\\nClick here for full coverage of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions' 2020 Rising Stars of Private Equity.\\n\\nIn the challenging times we face now, it's more important than ever to come together as a community and recognize the people and companies that excel and lead. We invite you to join us in honoring the 2019 winners of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions' M&amp;A Mid-Market Awards. In contrast with the volatile coronavirus-driven conditions unfolding in 2020, the dealmaking environment of 2019 was remarkably stable. Among the PE firms benefitting from the auspicious fundraising climate was Vista Private Equity, which raised a $16 billion fund - the largest technology-focused PE fund ever raised. Mergers &amp; Acquisitions is honoring Vista founder and CEO Robert F. Smith with our 2019 Dealmaker of the Year award. In addition to leading his firm's unprecedented fundraising, Smith excelled in philanthropy. When he spoke at the commencement of Morehouse College, he announced he would pay off all the student loans of the HBCU's 2019 graduates, providing a helping hand in the student debt crisis facing many U.S. families. The financial services sector saw a lot of consolidation in 2019. Piper Jaffray wins our 2019 Deal of the Year for buying Sandler O'Neill to form Piper Sandler, which instantly became a leading investment bank in the financial services sector. And Stifel wins our 2019 Investment Bank of the Year for growing dramatically and making several acquisitions.

Google's deals with Apple, mobile carriers and other handset makers to place its search engine as the default option for consumers accounted for most of its dominant market share in search, the agency said, a figure that it put at around 80 percent.\\n\\n\"For many years,\" the suit said, \"Google has used anticompetitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising and general search text advertising -- the cornerstones of its empire.\"\\n\\nThe lawsuit signals a new era for the technology sector. It reflects pent-up and bipartisan frustration toward a handful of companies -- Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook in particular -- that have morphed from small and scrappy companies into global powerhouses with outsize influence over commerce, speech, media and advertising. Conservatives like President Trump and liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren have called for more restraints over Big Tech.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nHere's the lawsuit. And here's Google's blogpost in response, titled \"A deeply flawed blogpost that would do nothing to help consumers\".\\n\\nSo. A little history. When Google was being sued by the EC in 2010 over its suppression of shopping comparison sites - beginning with the British company Foundem - I thought the EC was making the right move, and focusing on the correct topic: that Google was manipulating search to favour its own products over what consumers evidently wanted. Effectively, that's annexation: using your power in the market to push others out of an adjacent market.\\n\\nI thought the EC lawsuit against Google over tying Google services to Android was reasonable, too. It's a slightly different situation - an effective monopsony: Google's the only useful supplier for Android that people want outside China. (Ask Huawei.) The OEMs would all have to defect from Google to have any effect; and defection back would be more profitable.\\n\\nBut this? This is nonsense. There's no law against being a monopoly in the US. The 1998 lawsuit against Microsoft was about tying the provision of Windows to the use of Internet Explorer - when browsers were a new technology. IBM nearly missed out on the whole Windows95 launch because it resisted.\\n\\nThe FTC had an excellent chance to act on this right back in 2013 but whiffed it. If the DoJ and the states really want to make their case work, they should revisit that casework. But it wasn't about being a monopoly. It was about suppressing rivals in shopping search.\\n\\nBrian Chen spent ages trying to find 5G, and when he did it was basically to try out the Speedtest app; there's no real use for 5G. Then there's the rest of the phone:\\n\\n\"\\n\\nApple also said it had strengthened the display glass, making it four times less likely to break. It's difficult to test that scientifically, but I dropped the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro several times by accident on hard surfaces. They survived without any scuffs.\\n\\nAlso new is a charging mechanism that Apple calls MagSafe. It's basically a new standard to support faster charging via magnetic induction. The new standard will open doors to other companies to make accessories that magnetically attach to iPhones, such as miniature wallets.\\n\\nI tested both the MagSafe charger and Apple's MagSafe wallet. But I preferred charging with a normal wire because it was faster, as well as carrying my own wallet, because it can hold more cards.\\n\\nThere's a major downside to all of the new features: We have to pay a lot for these phones. Apple is also no longer including charging bricks or earphones with the new iPhones since so many people already own power bricks and fancy wireless earbuds. While that will lead to less waste, this shift and the price jump may annoy plenty of people.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nThere's also Nilay Patel's review at The Verge, which looks in more detail at the camera quality. He and his video producer are enthusiastic.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nSweden has banned Huawei Technologies and ZTE from gaining access to its fifth-generation wireless network, adding to the increasing number of European governments forcing local telecom companies to shift away from Chinese suppliers.\\n\\nThe Swedish Post and Telecom Authority said in a statement Tuesday that the \"influence of China's one-party state over the country's private sector brings with it strong incentives for privately owned companies to act in accordance with state goals and the communist party's national strategies.\"\\n\\nThe authority said that the two Chinese technology giants' equipment must be removed from existing infrastructure used for 5G frequencies by January 2025.\\n\\nThe US has described Huawei as the \"backbone\" of surveillance efforts by the Chinese communist party, and is pressuring European governments to block the technology company from gaining access to 5G networks. The UK has already imposed an outright ban on Huawei's 5G equipment, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel has so far hesitated to follow suit.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nAnother domino falls. Significant that it's banning ZTE as well. Though of course Sweden doesn't have to look far to find a network supplier: Ericsson is home-grown. Or it can give Nokia, in neighbouring Finland, a call.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nThis week we're going to talk about how YouTube broke HD for me and about 40% the UK population, give or take.\\n\\nI moved to a newer home earlier this year and like most places in the UK (even in London) it only had broadband internet aka slow ADSL over copper. It's pushing a good 4.2 Mbps, sometimes up to 4.6 Mbps on a good day.\\n\\nYouTube decided to rollout 60 FPS videos by default to everyone. It came in effect automatically for most videos published over the past couple years.\\n\\nHave a look at quality setting and see what pops up. If the video is relatively recent the options are usually limited to: 1080p60, 720p60, 480p ...\\n\\nThere's no setting and there's no opt-out to get back to 30 FPS. Like all software updates lately, the switch happened and there's nothing you can do about it.\\n\\nProblem: 60 FPS video requires roughly 50% more bandwidth than 30 FPS video.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nProblem arising from the fact that about 45% of UK households have a connection speed lower than 8Mbps, and you need above that for 1080p60fps; but only half that (which would work with most of the country) for 1080p30fps. It would be good if Google allowed a fallback to 30fps, but it doesn't seem to be doing that.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nlet's be honest with ourselves for a moment: when did you actually ever enjoy talking to a chat bot? And I'm not talking about the type of bots you talk to when you're bored, but about those that provide a deeper purpose.\\n\\nIt turns out that the answer is, at least for most of us, almost never.\\n\\nI love you Intercom, except when I don't. 99% of time I don't want to talk to a silly and obtrusive avatar popping up from some corner of the screen before I even had a chance to check out what's going on. Somehow, I can't help but think others feel the same.\\n\\nIn fact, we do know that others feel the same. Chat heads jumping at us unasked, are the quintessential equivalent of the infamous sales clerk who eagerly talks to us upon entering a store.\\n\\nTo further add to the challenges: as soon as users go off-script, chat bot's don't just become awkward and unpredictable -- they turn into little sociopaths that might rub users the wrong way.\\n\\nThe moment you create a chat bot is the moment you allow customers to have a conversation with your brand. Not with yourself, not with your friend, but with an uber entity -- a symbol -- that represents everything you and your team stand for. That's not a step to be taken lightly.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nPersonally, I never ever ever wanted to talk to a chatbot. You know that it's only an intermediate step towards dealing with a real human, or using a website with an interface you can navigate with your eyes, rather than an Adventure-style guessing game.\\n\\nBut they seem to be on the way out, so that's something.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nOrganizations that learn with AI have three essential characteristics:\\n\\n1. They facilitate systematic and continuous learning between humans and machines. Organizational learning with AI isn't just machines learning autonomously. Or humans teaching machines. Or machines teaching humans. It's all three. Organizations that enable humans and machines to continuously learn from each other with all three methods are five times more likely to realize significant financial benefits than organizations that learn with a single method.\\n\\n2. They develop multiple ways for humans and machines to interact. Humans and machines can and should interact in different ways depending on the context. Mutual learning with AI stems from these human-machine interactions. Deploying the appropriate interaction mode(s) in the appropriate context is critical. For example, some situations may require an AI system to make a recommendation and humans to decide whether to implement it. Some context-rich environments may require humans to generate solutions and AI to evaluate the quality of those solutions. We consider five ways to structure human-machine interactions. Organizations that effectively use all five modes of interaction are six times as likely to realize significant financial benefits compared with organizations effective at a single mode of interaction.\\n\\n3. They change to learn, and learn to change. Structuring human and machine interactions to learn through multiple methods requires significant, and sometimes uncomfortable, change. Organizations that make extensive changes to many processes are five times more likely to gain significant financial benefits compared with those that make only some changes to a few processes. These organizations don't just change processes to use AI; they change processes in response to what they learn with AI.\\n\\nOrganizational learning with AI demands, builds on, and leads to significant organizational change.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nThis sounds to me, without knowing the detail of the organisations, like they're obliged to change to fit with the demands of the AI, rather as organisations had to become more computer-like to better adjust to the broader use of computers. How many people in a day do you hear say \"just got to enter a few details into the computer, be with you in a minute...\"\\n\\n\"\\n\\nHave we reached \"peak subscription streaming\" in the way that some scientists fear that we're approaching \"peak oil,\" the theoretical point at which more oil has been extracted from the earth than remains in it? The streaming situation is far less grim -- peak oil assumes that production will decline, while streaming-subscription numbers will presumably stop growing but not decrease -- but there's one important parallel. Just as we're running out of \"easy oil\" and the price of a barrel increases as we move from drilling wells to more expensive extraction methods like fracking, we're also running out of what we might call \"easy subscribers\": young, tech-savvy music fans, many of whom have smartphones with iOS, which makes commerce easy. Finding more will require marketing, whether that means courting more Android users, selling skeptics on the value of music streaming or trying to take subscribers from other companies -- which costs money. It could also put pressure on services to lower prices, at precisely the point when they also have an incentive to raise them in order to show bottom-line growth.\\n\\nTo get a sense of what's ahead, it's worth looking at two markets that adapted to streaming early, Sweden and Norway, which make some of these concerns look a bit like the boy who cried wolf. Since 2015, when analysts first began predicting that music streaming services were running out of potential subscribers, the music business consultancy MIDiA estimates subscription numbers are up 85% in Sweden and 78% in Norway.\\n\\nThen again, remember what happened to that boy who cried wolf in the end? It could be that the predator is still on his way -- he just hasn't quite arrived yet.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nIn possibly related news, Netflix said subscriber growth slowed in the most recent quarter. (Via Benedict Evans's newsletter.)\\n\\n\"\\n\\nA little-known Democratic super PAC backed by some of Silicon Valley's biggest donors is quietly unleashing a torrent of television spending in the final weeks of the presidential campaign in a last-minute attempt to oust President Donald Trump, Recode has learned.\\n\\nThe barrage of late money -- which includes at least $22m from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz -- figures among one of the most expensive and aggressive plays yet by tech billionaires, who have spent years studying how to maximize the return they get from each additional dollar they spend on politics. Moskovitz is placing his single biggest public bet yet on the evidence that TV ads that come just before Election Day are the best way to do that.\\n\\nThe super PAC, called Future Forward, has remained under the radar but is spending more than $100m on television and digital in the final month of the campaign -- more than any other group -- on behalf of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden outside of the Biden campaign itself.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nWhat better way, when you deeply desire your advertising spend to have a meaningful effect, than to demonstrate the targeting power of advertising on the platform that you've helped create by *checks notes* using a completely different one.\\n\\n\"\\n\\n[US CIA official in charge of blocking Russian counterintel work, Marc] Polymeropoulos was stunned by how unabashedly combative his Russian counterparts were. He had spent his career in a region where people were exceedingly polite, rolling out banquets and plying him with tea, even as he knew they were plotting to kill him. He knew the Russians didn't like him, but \"I would have expected them to be a little more polite,\" Polymeropoulos told me.\\n\\nNonetheless, he figured that this was little more than bluster. He knew he had to be careful in Russia and to be wary of Russian agents trying to entrap him in compromising situations -- for example, the beautiful young women at the rooftop bar of the Moscow Ritz-Carlton who seemed determined to chat up him and his colleague. But Polymeropoulos figured he had no reason to fear for his physical safety. Even after that awful night in the Marriott, Polymeropoulos did not immediately suspect anything malicious. By morning, the worst of the symptoms had passed and he seemed to be doing better, confirming his suspicion that it had just been something he'd eaten. Just a few hours after he'd been incapacitated, he managed to get on a train to St. Petersburg, where he felt well enough to walk for miles, duck into more dive bars, and even glimpse the famous troll factory. He even did some Christmas shopping for his wife and kids. That miserable, terrifying night in his Moscow hotel room receded in his memory.\\n\\nTwo days before the end of his trip, Polymeropoulos and his colleagues were eating dinner at Pushkin, a posh Moscow restaurant, when he suddenly felt the room begin to spin again, just as it had in the hotel room that night. A wave of nausea hit, and he was suddenly drenched in sweat. He barely made it back to his hotel room, where, having canceled all his meetings, he stayed for the rest of his trip, unable to move. His body was in revolt, and he had no idea why. \"I made it back on the airplane somehow,\" Polymeropoulos said.\\n\\nIt wasn't until Polymeropoulos got home to the Virginia suburbs that it occurred to him that what had happened in Moscow was possibly the result of something far more sinister that what he'd originally suspected. In February, after a few weeks of relative normalcy, he started feeling an intense and painful pressure that started in the back of his head and radiated forward into his face.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nGiven Russians' proclivities, wonder if this and other cases was very low-grade chemical poisoning, not some sort of radiation.\\n\\nSarah Ditum on the popular response to New Zealand TV journalist Tova O'Brien demolishing failed political candidate Jami-Lee Ross:\\n\\n\"\\n\\nPerhaps it doesn't matter very much in the case of Ross. Advance got less than 1% of the vote, so you can hardly think of him as the representative of New Zealand's Covid-denying left-behinds. More worrying is the idea that O'Brien is some kind of role model for journalists -- \"the way it should be done\". What she offers is the stupefaction of a cheap pleasure, which is fine once in a while, but nothing you can live on. Turn this approach on an actually popular populist, rather than a sadsack failure content to soak up the last moments of his dead career, and you'd quickly have a polarised nightmare.\\n\\nRather than attack people as liars or presume their bad faith, Ripley suggests journalists should look for ways to open conversations: instead of telling people what they think, ask them about why they believe the things they do. Often, the things that people seem to be at odds over are just proxies for underlying issues; and sometimes, those underlying issues are more tractable than you ever expected.\\n\\nIt's even possible that the questioner could be the one to change their mind about something.\\n\\n\"\\n\\nI think this is wrong. Take Jonathan Swann's interview with Trump: while Swann didn't cut Trump off for talking nonsense, he absolutely did call him on his nonsense because he knew the indisputable facts. Ditto Chris Wallace, who had been wily enough to take the mental aptitude test that Trump was going to boast about, and so could contradict Trump from a position of knowledge.\\n\\nThe common thread in all three: being prepared with knowledge of what the facts are, and not being prepared to take dissembling crap around it.</td>\n",

It is owned as a separate business by Philip Day, whose EWM is also in crisis (see below).\\n\\nPhilip Day put this company into administration a few months ago, and reaquired it via a pre-pack. It is thought unlikely that he will do this again a second time.\\n\\nAge UK, the charity focused on supporting the elderly, closed 133 of its 392 charity outlets in 2020 and made 400 people redundant. During the first lockdown approximately 70 per cent of its staff were on furlough.\\n\\nDebenhams, the oldest retail chain in the UK, announced on December 1, 2020 that it had no alternative except to go into liquidation.\\n\\nBooHoo is to acquire the Debenhams' website, brands and goodwill, but close the Debenhams' stores, came on 25 January 2021.\\n\\nIt marks the end of a well-known retailer, whose problems stemmed from the manner in which the company was managed or exploited in the last 20 years.\\n\\nIn the past 35 years it has had a variety of owners none of which was fundamentally committed to the future of Debenhams Group or was able to introduce a coherent long-term strategy.\\n\\nArcadia, the fashion giant owned by Philip Green's wife in Monaco, went into administration on the last day of November 2020. It consists of the former Burton Group, with major subsidiaries Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Burtons, Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans.\\n\\nThese are all well-known brands. The administrators are allowing the stores and the website to continue to trade while new purchasers for the business or businesses are found. There are around 440 stores and 12,000+ staff.\\n\\nThe heyday of Philip Green's Arcadia was probably 2004-2007, but it failed to invest sufficiently in shops, IT or modern designs. Its dinner has been eated by upstarts like Primark, BooHoo, Zara, Next and even by grocery clothing lines.\\n\\nFor some years, the company has lacked a clear sense of direction and suffered from low investment and an unwillingness to develop its online sales. It has cut its store numbers by more than half since 2012. Comparatively staid business like John Lewis and Next have heavily invested in their online operations and now produce half their sales online.\\n\\nASOS, the UK online fashion retailer, has acquired from the shell of Arcadia the brands and websites of Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and the athleisure HIIT brands. The purchase excludes the retail stores owned by Arcadia, but there may be further news of these later.\\n\\nThe Irish arm of Arcadia comprising TopShop, Dotty P, Burton, Miss Selfridge etc have now closed and all 490 staff are being made redundant. The administrators have sold to online-retailer BooHoo, the online business and original Burton brands, Burtons, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis. Meanwhile, news from Deloitte is that Arcadia owed creditors as follows: HMRC £44.2m, suppliers £163m, landlords £35.5m and giftcard holders £5.6m. As secured creditors, the Green's family loan of £50m takes precedence over the unsecured creditors. The bill for taxpayers will be around £250m+, consisting of the redundancy pay owing to sacked staff and supporting the pension scheme.\\n\\nEdinburgh Woollen Mill and Ponden Mill, both parts of Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group (EWM Group), went into administration in November.\\n\\nBut Pureplay Retail Limited, a company backed by 'international investors', has since taken over the EWM Group along with Bonmarché which owed £190m to creditors.\\n\\nPureplay has taken over 50 Bonmarché stores (1,000 staff) and 246 EWM and Ponden Home sites (1,452 staff). Bonmarché originally had 225 stores when it went into administration. Around 85 EWM and 34 Ponden Home stores will be closed and their 485 staff will lose their jobs.\\n\\nThis is in addition to the 64 closures and 860 staff that lost their jobs when EWM originally went into administration.\\n\\nIt seems that Philip Day, the founder of the EWM Group, may have lent investors some of the money required to buy out his operations, but retains fixed and floating charges as a secured creditor over the business along with Pureplay Retail Limited. Under the new agreement, Philip Day seems to have retained ownership of the various brands that are franchised to Pureplay Retail.\\n\\nJ Crew, American 'preppy' clothing retailer, is to close all six of its UK stores making their staff redundant. Its parent company has recently emerged from administration and seems to have decided to liquidate its UK subsidiary.\\n\\nCeline Group Holdings, the parent company of Debenhams, has called in FRP Advisory to prepare for its own administration.\\n\\nThis is understood to have been done to prevent any creditor taking action against them in the period when Debs is up for sale and trying to find a new owner.\\n\\nIt is said that interest is overdue on £200m of loans made to Celine: administration would mean there would be no need to pay it. Any administration of Celine would not affect Debenhams store operation per se.\\n\\nM&amp;Co, the Scots-based value clothing retailer previously called Mackays, has gone into administrators and been bought by its previous owners as part of a pre-pack to save the business. There are 262 stores and 2,700 employees.\\n\\nThe covid-19 lockdown cost the firm more than £50m: in its last financial year profits fell by 40 per cent to £3.6m. Forty-seven stores are to close (380 redundancies) as part of its recovery plan.\\n\\nD W Sports, a sportswear and gym retailer owned by Dave Whelan, went into administration in the first days of August.\\n\\nThe company's outlets - as non-essential retailers - have been closed since lockdown started: its 73 gyms were about to re-open until the change in government policy that postponed the resumption of trading by gymnasia, bowling alleys etc.\\n\\nThere are 75 DW Sports retail stores: these will all close in four weeks. The Group has a total of 1,700 employees. Twenty-five stores have closed already.\\n\\nThe Fitness First Group which is also owned by Dave Whelan is not to go into administration: its 43 clubs will remain trading.\\n\\nFeather &amp; Black, the award-winning bed specialist rescued in 2017 from administration, has been bought by Dreams.\\n\\nNone of its stores is to reopen after the easing of lockdown. It will become online only, probably with concessions in Dreams.\\n\\nOutstanding orders will be honoured. The Company was rumoured last February to be up for sale, so these closures are not strictly caused by coronavirus, although being closed for three months would not have helped its chances of survival.\\n\\nGrosvenor Shopping Centre in Chester went into receivership along with its car park earlier in July 2020. It was originally built in the 1960s and refurbished in the 80s. There are 101 retail units, all on one level. The Shopping centre continues trading.\\n\\nOliver Sweeney Trading, the retail arm of the prestige shoe company Oliver Sweeney Group, was placed in administration in mid-July.\\n\\nAll its seven stores are closed as the company sees its retail future as online only. This administration does not affect the wholesaling and online arms of the business.\\n\\nMuji, the Japanese high-street homewares retailer, has applied for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. It has debts of $64m and the Covid-19 lockdowns in the UK and the U.S. have hit it hard.\\n\\nIt won't be included in our UK figures, but, under U.S. law the corporation will be required to produce an exit plan to revamp the company. This may well have implications for UK stores. The stores continue to trade.\\n\\nCardinal, the Yorkshire-based firm of shopfitters (outfitting or remodelling store interiors), went into administration in mid-July.\\n\\nOne hundred and thirty-five staff amongst its 170 employees have already been made redundant. Their business has been hit by the pandemic.\\n\\nIn addition their customers (i.e. the retailers) were unable to make firm commitments about work they needed in 2020, H2, into 2021.\\n\\nThe impact of Covid-19 upon retailers has meant that most companies are now unsure about the number, type and location of stores that they are going to need in 2021-2025. The collapse of work for Cardinal is a symptom of the bloodbath on the high street.\\n\\nSoletrader, a footwear retailer established in 1962, went into a creditors' voluntary liquidation in mid-July 2020. Its assets including stock and brand names Sole and Soletrader were purchased by its owner, the Twinmar Group, and are now invested in a new subsidiary, Twinmar London.\\n\\nMost of the company's stores opened for trading in July, but eight shops have been closed. Soletrader's website is a separate entity and is unaffected by the liquidation.\\n\\nPeter Jones (China), a 50-year old crockery and gift business based in Wakefield, went into administration in mid-July. It had not opened after the lockdown eased. There were ten stores and 76 staff. The business is expected to be liquidated.\\n\\nNorville Group, a Gloucestershire-based firm of opticians and optical suppliers to the industry, went into administration early in June after selling its nine Norville Opticians' practices the previous week.\\n\\nSince then the former Norville laboratories, which were renowned for being able to produce lens to the very highest standard, have been acquired from administration by Inspecs, the new owner of the Norville Group, and continue to trade.\\n\\nBenson Beds, the beds and bedding business owned by Alteri, was put into pre-pack administration at the same time as Harveys (see below).\\n\\nAlteri bought the business out immediately and put £25m into the company to invest in its development. There are 242 stores and 1,900 staff. Bensons (at present) is seen as a much better business than Harveys, most UK bedding is made in the UK, it faces less competition from overseas operators and Alteri is likely to focus on improving its operations, while keeping Harveys Furniture stable. The company continues to trade and existing orders will be fulfilled.\\n\\nHarveys Furniture, the second largest furniture retailer in the UK, was put into administration by its owners, Alteri Investors on the last day of June.\\n\\nThere are 105 stores, which have been struggling for some years, and 1,575 staff. The company is looking to close 20 stores and make 240 staff redundant. The company continues to trade and existing orders will be satisfied.\\n\\nT M Lewin, retailer of shirts and ties online and in 65 stores, went into administration on the last day of June after failing to find a buyer.\\n\\nThe shops have not re-opened following the relaxation of the lockdown. The business had been acquired from Bain private equity only last month (May). The new owners, SCP Private Equity, expect to close all the stores, making the company online only. Six hundred employees are likely to lose their jobs.\\n\\nBertram Books, the Norwich-based book wholesaler, went into administration towards the end of June 2020 with debts now (Aug 2020) known to be £25m.\\n\\nMost of its 450 workforce has been made redundant. Bertrams was particularly important to smaller publishing companies.\\n\\nChanges in the book market in the last 20 years including the growth of online sales and dramatic price cutting, highly-promoted 'blockbusters', the growth of Amazon and direct-to-customer applications as well as e-books adversely affected Bertram Books' business model.\\n\\nBut sub-optimal decision-making by a succession of uncommitted owners have also brought it down.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic, closing both libraries and bookshops, proved to be the final blow for Bertram Books.\\n\\nIntu Properties, the major property company that owns and manages some of the largest and best UK retail malls, went into administration on 26 June 2020. Many of its retail clients are not paying their rents and INTU's creditors are not as forebearing.\\n\\nIt has total debts of £4.5bn, a merger with a European property company came to nothing and it has failed to raise more capital. Its recent negotiations with other parties, where it hoped to arrange a 'standstill agreement' with its lenders, led to no useful outcome, so it went into administration.\\n\\nMajor sites include Lakeside, Glasgow's Braehead, Manchester's Trafford Centre, Nottingham's Victoria Centre and Norwich's Chapelfield. This administration will be a major blow to the UK retail sector, although, coming after many other impossible-to-believe 'major blows', its significance may be less apparent.\\n\\nIt may not be possible for the Administrators to run all the shopping centres without outside funding, although so far all sites have been kept open. It is still possible that many of their shopping centres will close unless a new potential buyer acquires some or all of them.\\n\\nGo Outdoors, the outdoor sports, walking, climbing, camping, riding and exercise retailer owned by JD Sports, went into administration towards the end of June.\\n\\nIt was immediately bought out of administration by J D Sports for £56.5m (pre-pack administration), enabling the company to be reorganised. J D Sports has stated that it wishes needs to re-think the Go Outdoors business but does not expect large-scale redundancies and closures.\\n\\nThere are 2,400 employees and 67 stores. Since the firm was bought by JD Sports it has lost £291m (to August 2019) and the massive losses caused by the coronavirus lockdown have only worsened the situation. In July, the Administrators estimated that unsecured creditors would receive only 1p in the £1.\\n\\nLee Longlands, the Birmingham-based upmarket furniture retailer, went into administration towards the end of June to enable the company to restructure and improve cash flow. The company continues to trade and outstanding orders will be met.\\n\\nThere are six stores, mostly in the Midlands. Lee Longlands was purchased via a management buy-out in 2015. The company started in Broad Street Bham as an antiques business in 1902.\\n\\nPoundstretcher Properties, a company connected to discount-chain Poundstretcher, is to be placed into administration as part of a CVA programme by 450-store group Poundstretcher to reorganise its store portfolio, cut rents and reduce other costs.\\n\\nThe Poundstretcher Group has argued that around 250 stores will close if the CVA is not approved by its creditors. Poundstrecher Properties holds the leases on only 23 stores and this will not affect the legal position or ownership of the group as a whole. Poundstretcher faces the same issues as the rest of the high street, compounded by the lockdown, now in its 85th day (it is really that long?).\\n\\nOak Furnitureland, the specialist furniture store that started off on eBay, has gone into administration, and was immediately bought out of administration (pre-pack) by hedge-fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management.\\n\\nThere are 105 showrooms and 1,491 employees. The business continues still to trade, but the new owner expects to rationalise the business, probably through the closure of some stores and reductions in staff.\\n\\nLe Pain Quotidien, the French-themed retailer, bread/coffee/restaurant chain, went into pre-pack administration in mid-June. It has been bought out of administration by a new vehicle, BrunchCo21, believed to be linked to its former owner, Cobepa. Ten of its 26 outlets have been closed with the loss of around 200 jobs in stores and the closure of its head office.\\n\\nThe new owners expect to negotiate T&amp;C with the landlords of the remaining 16 properties, and the results may lead of course to further closures.\\n\\nMonsoon Accessorize, the womenswear and accessories chain with 181 stores, went into administration early in June. It is a private company owned by its founder, Peter Simon: it started as a market stall.\\n\\nMonsoon Accessorize was immediately bought out of administration by Peter Simon. Thirty-five stores are to be closed with 545 employees being made redundant.\\n\\nThe business had 181 stores and 2,534 UK staff before administration. It is understood that Monsoon does not expect that every landlord will agree to the new conditions, but hopes to save around 100 stores and 2,300 jobs. The stores are based on careful, edited retailing which only encountered problems in the last decade.\\n\\nIn 2019 the company survived a previous crisis through a large cash injection from its owner, the closure of 40 stores and a CVA that cut rents on three-quarters of its stores.\\n\\nMonsoon's international business is unaffected, with 49 stores and 966 staff outside the UK.\\n\\nQuiz, the Glasgow-based fashion group, put its physical stores division into administration in early June. Ninety-three head-office and warehouse redundancies have already been declared. The business wants to renegotiate rents for its 82 stores and the eventual size of the group will only be known, when this has been done. KPMG has been appointed to review the firm's options, which are likely to include store closures. There are 915 staff in the stores division. Quiz's online business continues unaffected, as are its 300+ concessions.\\n\\nVictoria's Secret, the UK arm of the U.S.-owned global retailer, went into administration early in June 2020 having made a loss now known (Aug 2020) to be £100m in the last financial year. The UK fashion trade has experienced a torrid three years and the coronavirus lockdown, which prevented 'non-essential' stores trading (though not online), has been the final hammer blow. There are 25 stores and 800 staff. The company is reported as looking for a light-touch administration, allowing them to restructure the business, reduce costs and possibly find a new owner.\\n\\nAldo, a Canadian-based international chain of stores, went into administration early in May. Five UK stores have been permanently closed, leaving eight surviving while the administrators seek new owners for the UK business. The UK network is up for sale, but many of the stores are franchised and are not 'owned' by Aldo Canada. Aldo shoes, handbags and accessories are still available for purchase in the UK both online and in its 28 UK concessions. The Irish arm of Aldo has already gone into administration. The company and its brands (chiefly 'Aldo' and 'Call It Spring') are major international businesses, operating around 3,000 stores globally served by 20,000 staff. Apart from the UK, Aldo businesses are expected to reopen as each government permits in the post-coronavirus world.\\n\\nDVF Studio, the luxury fashion company owned by Diane von Furstenberg, has gone into administration, citing 'coronavirus', and is closing its Mayfair store. The company has an online business as well as concessions in prestigious department stores, including Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. It announced earlier in 2020 that it was starting a subscription luxury service. The e-commerce business and concessions continue to trade.\\n\\nAntler, the luggage retailer which runs 18 stores and a concession, went into administration in mid-May. There are 194 employees: 164 of these have been made redundant. The Administrators announced in mid-July that they had successfully sold the brand name, Online business, stock and assets, but the stores remain closed and there was no news of their future.\\n\\nJohnsons' Shoes, also trading as Bowleys Fine Shoes, went into administration in mid-May. There are 12 stores, all in the South East of England. The 145 furloughed staff will retain their jobs as the administrators seek to reopen the businesses. The group was later acquired by Newjohn Limited, part of Daniel Footwear. Six stores were closed.\\n\\nDawson's Music, one of the oldest stores selling musical instruments (est. 1898), went into administration early in May. There are six stores in Leeds, Manchester, Chester, Liverpool, Reading and Belfast. It is still open and is hoping to be sold as a going concern. There are 75 staff. The coronavirus lockdown proved to be the last straw for a retail group that was already facing a decline in sales. There is also an Educational Division which supplies schools, colleges and universities. In late May, the chain was purchased by Andrew and Karen Oliver, who took over all the stores and retained the staff.\\n\\nJ Crew, the U.S. fashion retailer with six UK stores, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the beginning of May. It has 500 stores in the U.S., trades online, and owns the J Crew Factory and Madewell brands. It intends to continue trading online while it gives control of the business to its lenders who will cancel debts of $1.65bn (£1.3bn). It is unclear how this will affect its UK business.\\n\\nL K Bennet, the fashion retailer which went into administration in March 2019, is to extend its administration for another twelve months. The company expects to open seven stores on 15 June 2020 (when non-essential stores are allowed to start trading) with the remaining 10 stores to open at a later date.\\n\\nOasis and Warehouse, two fashion retailers owned by Icelandic-Bank Kaupthing, went into administration in mid-April 2020, having failed to find a buyer for the group. All its 92 stores were closed, 2,300 staff made redundant and the 437 concessions terminated. The 13 stores and 29 concessions in the Irish Republic had already gone in into administration under Irish law: there were 248 staff in Ireland. The Oasis and Warehouse brands and e-commerce operations were bought by Hilco, which sold them in June to BooHoo, the successful e-commerce apparel business. BooHoo raised £200m in May to help it take advantage of 'opportunities', and now also owns brands such as NastyGal, PrettyLittleThing, Karen Millen, MissPap and Coast. Concessions and stores in other countries will continue to trade. Oasis and Warehouse had been suffering recently from the problems common to most UK mid-range fashion businesses. The coronavirus lockdown - closing all its stores - made it impossible to continue operating and ended any chance of a sale.\\n\\nSpicers, the office-supplies wholesaler, employing 1,200 people started by John Spicer in 1796 ceased trading in April. It built up a European presence, but the UK arm and the European operations were separated in 2011, Spicers being bought by Better Capital, the private equity firm controlled by John Moulton. When it went into administration its administrators were not able to sell it and the business was liquidated.\\n\\nSimply Scuba, an award-winning diving retailer based in Faversham, went into administration in June. Thirty-two jobs are at risk. The Simply Group also runs SimplyHike and SimplySwim. The Simply Scuba website continues to trade.\\n\\nKath Kidston, the vintage-inspired fashion and accessories chain, appointed administrators early in April 2020. It has now announced that it will close its UK branches, concentrating on Asia, the wholesale business and online sales. The company - like many fashion retailers - has had problems in maintaining sales and profitability. Since 2018 it lost £27m, resulting in its closing stores and cutting head-office staff. There are 200 stores globally. All 60 UK sites are to close, with only 32 of its 941 UK staff being retained. It will now operate in the UK as an online-only retailer. The company's owners, Barings Private Equity Asia, have bought it out of administration on a pre-pack basis, having previously tried to sell it. Finances were so poor towards the end that initially Kath Kidson announced that they would only be paying part of the wages owed to employees: they have now agreed to make payments in full, but a up to a week late. The company suppliers, including HMRC and clothing manufacturers, are owned £90m by the failed company.\\n\\nAutonomy Clothing, a small fashion chain with three stores, 100 concessions and 44 staff, went into administration towards the end of March 2020. It has been beset by the same problems as the rest of the industry, the lockdown being the last straw. All employees have been made redundant.\\n\\nLombok, the aspirational furniture and furnishings business, went into administration at the end of March. It operates both online and offline and is best known for its teak products made mostly from reclaimed timber. It has experienced two pre-pack administrations before (2009 and 2011). All 43 staff have been made redundant.\\n\\nBrighthouse, the rent-to-own household goods retailer, appointed administrators at the end of March 2020. There are 240 stores and 2,700 employees. The administration does not affect customers that rent goods, as their obligations will transfer first to the administrators and then to any new owner. The business mainly deals with low-income households and was fined by the financial regulator for mis-selling and 'unfair' interest charged as part of consumer transactions. The compensation it must pay to 250,000 customers is understood to cost £1m per month and its most-recent financial report (February 2020) showed showed corporate losses of £16m.\\n\\nLaura Ashley, the fashion retailer with 155 stores, went into administration in mid-March 2020. The administrators permanently closed 70 of the company's outlets: 1,669 staff were furloughed and 677 staff continued working in the business with more redundancies announced in mid-June. Only 18 of its remaining stores have re-opened post lockdown, though this may not be ominous. Gordon Bros have been allowed to purchase the Laura Ashley brand and its archives, leaving the future of the stores, logistics and manufacturing in Britain and Ireland unresolved. The Pension Protection Fund is asking for another administrator to be appointed to ensure the protection of Laura Ashley shareholders. Administration comes after a long period of poor results from a retailer that had been a star in the 80s and early 90s. The post-2016 deterioration in fashion sales affecting most clothing retailers was certainly a factor, but the failure of the business to match modern consumer requirements meant it was difficult to see the purpose of the company.\\n\\nKikki.K, an Australian-based retail group selling Swedish-designed stationery, has gone into voluntary administration as a result of the problems of Australian retailing plus the cost of its global expansion (now including Hong Kong, the UK, Singapore and New Zealand). There are up to five stores in the UK, three shops-within-shops in stores like Fortnum &amp; Mason and Selfridges and an online business which, in Europe, seems now to be switched through to Australia. There are 100 stores globally. The Australian stores remain open, but the UK online business is currently uncontactable due to 'unprecedented shipping delays'.\\n\\nHomebase, the DIY chain, has returned to profit after its experiences first as Bunnings UK and then a large CVA case. It used its CVA to cut rents and close more than 70 stores. It is therefore quitting its CVA eighteen months early. CVAs have had mixed results when used by retailers, but this is one that seems to have turned up trumps for the business.\\n\\nSoak, a major online bathroom products retailer, went into administration at the end of February. The market is intensely competitive and Soak's revenue fell from £70m (2018) to £43m (2019). Its profit on the 2018 figures was only £2.9m. Price competition between online and bricks-and-mortar retailers has meant that few operators are making much of a profit, hence the decline of Soak and the collapse of other kitchen and bathroom retailers, such as Better Bathrooms. There are 220 employees.\\n\\nT J Hughes Outlet Division has issued a notice of intended administration for its Outlet Division, prior to renegotiating their rents. Lewis's Home Retail Limited, a subsidiary of LHR Holdings (the master company for T J Hughes), owns eight stores, two of which have already been saved via agreed rent reductions. This does not affect the whole Group, but only outlet stores.\\n\\nHonestJohn.co.uk, the online advice website for car owners, went into administration and has been bought by Heycar, an online retailer of used cars. The staff, IP and assets have been transferred.\\n\\nAshbury Furniture, a large furniture and soft furnishings salesroom, went into administration in February, caused by constant road engineering on the M20 (making it hard to get to the showroom) and the impact of rent and rates.\\n\\nEna Shaw, a producer and retailer of soft furnishings based in St Helens, went into administration in February 2020, closing its factory and store. There were 167 employees.\\n\\nOddbins, the wine and drinks off-licence business of European Food Brokers, went into administration at the beginning of February. There are 56 stores, mostly trading as Oddbins or Wine Cellars: two have now closed. Employees number around 567. Less than one year ago 45 EFB off-licence businesses were sold or closed on the basis that they were no longer viable.\\n\\nHearing and Mobility, a specialist national chain of hearing and mobility stores, has ceased trading and administrators have been appointed. Hearing and Mobility (HHML) is a Northampton-based company founded in 2002 with 18,000 customers. It established a chain of 27 hearing and mobility stores throughout Britain, later focusing mainly on the Midlands and the South with 15 stores. Starting in 2016, the company closed many of its mobility stores to concentrate on hearing disabilities. The company rarely made a profit and by January 2020 had only four stores. After its stores had 'temporarily' ceased trading they were sold to two other companies trading in this vertical market. Amplify Hearing has acquired HHML hearing operations, assets and 76 staff, enabling customers to continue being provided with service.\\n\\nHawkins Bazaar, a Norwich-based games retailer with a focus on adult merchandise, went into administration in the latter days of January. There are 20 stores and 177 staff. The company went into administration previously in 2011. Weak trading in 2019 and a poor Christmas have led the firm's current problems. The stores will remain open while a buyer is found, but by mid-February were all to close.\\n\\nHouseology, a Glasgow-based e-commerce furniture business, has gone into administration after a doleful Christmas. Twenty-three staff have been made redundant. Bureau, its office-oriented associate business, continues to trade and is not affected by Houseology's failure. By the end of February Houseology's assets including IP had been acquired by competitor Olivia, part of the Moot Group. Moot Group started in 2018 and is targeting turnover of £20m by end-2020.\\n\\nBeales, a 22-store department store chain, went into into administration, having failed to find a new owner or additional finance in the latter end of 2019. At first, the company's stores remained open in the hope that a new owner could be found. They have all now closed. The loss-making stores in the Midlands and the South were closed suddenly when no new owner cold be found, and were followed a fortnight later by the remaining stores, which were mostly in East Anglia. Losses rose from -£1.3m in 2018 to -£3.1m in 2019 and poor trading over Christmas made it essential to secure new funding. The company had announced in December 2019 that it was in difficulties and needed refinancing. Beales employed more than 1,200 staff. Colliers International reported in January 2020 that Beales was paying £2.85m in business rates, £1m more than should have been the case.\\n\\n2021\\n\\nJessops, the chain of camera dealers now with only 17 stores, appointed administrators at the end of March. It had previously gone into administration at the end of 2019, after which it closed more than half its stores. In the Lockdowns the shops have been unable to trade and more and more business is shifting online. There are around 120 staff.\\n\\nThe Hummingbird Bakery, a London-based American-style bakery, has been bought by pre-pack administration by Acropolis Capital, a family investment company. The Hummingbird bakery and three of its stores are part of the pre-pack, but two other sites are excluded.\\n\\nPreston St George's Shopping Centre went into the control of administrators on February 2 2021, when its parent company (InfraRed) entered administration. InfraRed acquired the Shopping Centre in 2015 for £73m, supported by a loan from Wells Fargo Bank. Trading continues as normal, although the Preston Centre, in common with every UK shopping mall, has suffered considerably from the closure of non-food stores in Lockdown.\\n\\nPaperchase, the up-market stationery, student accessories and gift business, has gone through a pre-pack administration, closing 37 stores with the loss of 500 jobs. Before issuing a notice of intent to appoint administrators in early January 2021, the company had 127 stores and around 1,500 staff. The new owners are to be Permira. Around 40 per cent of Paperchase sales occur in November and December each year, but government restrictions have meant that most stores had been closed for up to six of its best shopping weeks.\\n\\nJaeger brand and stock have been purchased by Marks &amp; Spencer, but not its staff and stores. All 63 Jaeger stores and concessions, its retail staff and 80 per cent of head office staff will be made redundant apart from a few employees in distribution and head office. The brands Austin Reed and Jacques Vert, previously operating as part of the Jaeger Group, did not form part of the M&amp;S acquisition.</td>\n",

The funding round includes returning investors DCVC, BV, Tencent, Y Combinator, Dolby Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, as well as new backing from two top ten global insurance companies. This brings the total amount of capital raised to date to almost $175 million. The company has appointed Raj Ganguly of B Capital Group as a new board member and Hani Enaya of Sanabil as a board observer.\\n\\n\"Over the past three years, our platform AtomNetÂ® has tackled - and succeeded - in finding small molecule hits for more undruggable targets than any other AI drug discovery platform,\" said Abraham Heifets, CEO and co-founder of Atomwise. \"With support from our new and existing investment partners, we will be able to leverage this to develop our own pipeline of small molecule drug programs, further grow our portfolio of joint-venture investments, and realize our vision to create better medicines that can improve the lives of billions of people.\"\\n\\nWith the new investment, Atomwise will continue to scale its AI technology platform and team. The company plans to expand its work with corporate partners, which currently include major players in the biopharma space such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bayer, Hansoh Pharmaceuticals, and Bridge Biotherapeutics, as well as emerging biotechnology companies like StemoniX and SEngine Precision Medicine. Atomwise has signed more than $5.5 billion in total deal value with corporate partners to date.\\n\\nThe company will also leverage the financing to build its own internal pipeline tackling historically undruggable and other challenging disease targets. Atomwise will continue to grow its portfolio of joint ventures with leading researchers using AtomNetÂ® for drug discovery, like those it has launched with X-37, Atropos Therapeutics, Theia Biosciences and vAIrus, with a goal to commercialize high potential candidates through the drug development process.\\n\\nAtomwise created the first convolutional neural networks (CNN) for drug discovery, and since its founding in 2012 has continually developed and improved its AI-based drug discovery technology. The company's AI technology has been used by academic researchers at institutes around the world and drug developers - including top-100 pharmaceutical and emerging biotechnology companies, a rapidly growing market estimated to reach $729B in global market value by 2025. Researchers and companies struggle with access to AI-based drug discovery technology, due to overall cost and lack of expertise - something which requires computational scientists, drug discovery experts, software and systems engineers for AI and ML. To date, Atomwise has provided AI technology to over 750 research collaborations addressing over 600 disease targets, and worked with top-pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners, to design new drugs for \"undruggable\" targets with speed and scale.\\n\\nThrough these academic collaborations, Atomwise has enriched its AtomNetÂ® technology with experimental data and conducted the largest screening of molecules in human history - today at over 16 billion molecules for virtual screening. From the continued use of AtomNetÂ® among research teams, Atomwise has gained a valuable breadth of experimental data, including the largest diversity of drug target sites, homology models, protein classes, and disease areas of any AI platform. The company's technology is covered by 19 issued patents, and research partnerships have generated 17 pending patent applications and several peer-reviewed publications. Atomwise has 285 active drug discovery partnerships with researchers at top universities around the world, and recently announced 15 research collaborations with global universities to explore broad-spectrum therapies for COVID-19, targeting 15 unique and novel mechanisms of action.\\n\\n\"New technologies are enabling better and faster R&amp;D for the life science industry,\" said Raj Ganguly, co-Founder and Managing Partner at B Capital Group. \"The advancements Atomwise has made with its computational drug discovery platform have effectively cut months or even years off of the R&amp;D lifecycle. More importantly, however, they are solving biology problems previously believed to be unsolvable by researchers and delivering that capability to everyone from academics to big pharma. We're excited to continue to partner with the Atomwise team on its mission to develop new, more effective therapies.\"\\n\\nA spokesperson for Sanabil Investments added, \"We chose to lead this B round as Atomwise has shown clear leadership in developing better medicines for the world, and has become the number one global leader in applying and scaling its AI platform for drug discovery programs. Even more important is the prominence and strategic reputation of the new and returning investors, and their expertise in AI, drug discovery and pharma. They all believe, like we do, that Atomwise will use the funding to strengthen and develop their strategic advantages where it counts.\"\\n\\nIf you're a drug discovery team interested in learning more about Atomwise, please visit our website or email partners@atomwise.com.\\n\\nAbout Atomwise\\n\\nAtomwise Inc. invented the first deep learning AI technology for structure-based small molecule drug discovery.

to peer P2P home sharing movement but it has also helped drive an ecosystem of me too rivals and complementary companies aimed at property managers On the flip side Airbnb and its ilk have also forced traditional accommodation providers such as hotels to rethink their business models This pattern is also evident in the ride hailing industry where a whole new breed of startup has sprung up to provide everything from in car commerce and advertising to predictive analytics and more At the same time established taxi companies have had to embrace the kind of technology that powers Uber and the rest But the tech underpinning on demand transport platforms is having an impact far beyond the taxi industry Virtual kitchens sometimes referred to as dark restaurants virtual brands ghost kitchens or any combination thereof have been popping up all over due in large part to the rise of on demand transport infrastructure In 2019 the trend reached a fever pitch with numerous investments and fresh takes on the concept Virtual kitchens are essentially strategically placed kitchens that specialize in delivery only no walk in or sit down customers allowed The general idea is that restaurants can expand their footprint into high demand areas with minimal upfront investment and lower overhead given that prime real estate is not required Virtual kitchens can also allow existing restaurants to experiment with bespoke menus and offer new items without impacting their existing brand To reach customers these businesses usually lean on transport infrastructure provided by the likes of Uber Eats Deliveroo Postmates GrubHub DoorDash and Caviar Kitchen in the cloud U K based food delivery giant Deliveroo which counts Amazon as a major investor recently revealed that it now claims 2 000 virtual restaurant brands in the U K alone a 150 increase on the previous year Deliveroo has operated delivery only kitchens called editions since 2017 This basically involves setting up near areas that are likely to have a big demand for food delivery with Deliveroo offering an arsenal of data to help identify specific culinary preferences It s all about spotting gaps in the market and you might see a small industrial estate with several cabins working on various types of cuisine Deliveroo was far from the first to embrace this concept New York based Maple had operated a similar model out of Manhattan for a couple of years but that ultimately faltered and Deliveroo bought it out in 2017 Another New York based delivery only kitchen called Ando was acquired by Uber Eats last year Elsewhere in Europe Spain based on demand delivery startup Glovo last week raised 167 million at a valuation of more than 1 billion making it one of just a handful of private Spanish startups to hit unicorn status A large chunk of Glovo s cash injection will go toward delivery only restaurants and grocery stores In fact the startup currently operates seven dark stores in Europe and Latin America and is planning 100 similar locations by 2021 The technology landscape over the past 12 months reveals a similar picture investors are hungry for delivery only restaurants The Uber factor As Uber struggles to cut losses across its business Uber Eats now represents its fastest growing unit with a customer base of well over 90 million users and sales growth of 64 in the past year Uber has also been promoting virtual kitchens although these typically operate out of existing restaurants with a different brand and separate menus designed for delivery However the impact of Uber s foray into the virtual kitchen realm is clear Uber cofounder and former CEO Travis Kalanick has launched a new venture called CloudKitchens which touts itself as a real estate company that provides smart kitchens for delivery only restaurants Last month it closed a 400 million funding round at a reported 5 billion valuation Another new startup called Virtual Kitchen Co launched out of stealth last month with 17 million in funding from an illustrious list of backers that includes Andreessen Horowitz a16z and Uber Eats product head Stephen Chau Virtual Kitchen Co was founded by Ken Chong who formerly led Uber s marketplace product team Matt Sawchuk who launched Uber s first peer to peer ride sharing service before moving into a role with Uber Eats and Andro Radonich Virtual Kitchen Co has already helped a few virtual kitchens open in San Francisco with plans to open more than a dozen additional locations in the Bay Area alone in early 2020 We think with a combination of technology data science and rigorous operational abilities it s possible to make running a high volume delivery restaurant an easy complete solution that lets even the smallest food entrepreneurs take advantage of the massive food delivery market said a16z general partner Andrew Chen Virtual Kitchen Co utilizes data to figure out where to best locate their network of kitchens what cuisines are lacking in underserved neighborhoods and even what ingredients should go into which dishes By sharing and collaborating with restaurant partners it will make the ecosystem even better Scramble In September Pasadena California based Kitchen United closed a 40 million series B round of funding co led by Alphabet s GV and New York real estate giant RXR Realty Similar to others in the space Kitchen United offers prospective customers or food entrepreneurs warehouse type facilities that can house up to 20 different restaurants This again is underpinned by a data driven technology platform to help guide menu and location choices Various similar cloud kitchen startups have sprung up around the world and investors have been lining up in droves In Latin America Columbia based Muy this year secured a 15 million cash injection while London based Taster which is creating native food brands for delivery companies like Glovo Uber Eats and Deliveroo raised 8 million And in Germany Keatz locked down 13 million in funding Setting up a traditional sit down restaurant is a costly endeavor and fraught with risk By crunching large swathes of data spanning demographics location and food preferences cloud kitchens promise to sidestep both issues in one fell swoop The data lets them know where to set up and what food to sell and fancy facilities with long leases are simply not necessary A report released last year by Investment bank UBS titled Is the Kitchen Dead estimated that the 35 billion food delivery economy could grow tenfold within a decade The rise of virtual kitchens will undoubtedly play a major role in driving down the cost of meals making it far more likely that people will order takeout instead of cooking at home There could be a scenario where by 2030 most meals currently cooked at home are instead ordered online and delivered from either restaurants or central kitchens the report said The ramifications for the food retail food producer and restaurant industries could be material as well as the impact on property markets home appliances and robotics This is the very definition of disruption Technology platforms that were originally conceived to connect drivers with passengers have not only changed the taxi industry they re also transforming freight and trucking and other spinoff sectors And as we have seen with the rapid rise of cloud kitchens this year the restaurant industry is the next frontier</td>\n",

It said it will develop unique and affordable financial products for Walmart employees and customers.\\n\\nShares were up more than 2% on the news in after-hours trading Monday. Walmart's market cap is $416.7 billion.\\n\\nThe fintech startup will be majority-owned by Walmart and its board will include several company executives, including its Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs and Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner. It said it will also name independent industry experts to the board and may acquire or partner with other fintech companies.\\n\\n\"For years, millions of customers have put their trust in Walmart to not only save them money when they shop with us but help them manage their financial needs,\" Furner said in a news release. \"And they've made it clear they want more from us in the financial services arena.\"\\n\\nWith more than 4,700 stores across the country, Walmart interacts with millions of customers each year - including some who don't have a relationship with a bank or a financial advisor.\\n\\nSix percent of adults don't have a checking, savings or money market account, according to the Federal Reserve. About 16% are \"underbanked,\" meaning they have a bank account but also use alternative financial service products, like a money order. Those Americans are more likely to turn to short-term solutions, such as a pawn shop or a payday loan, which can lead to additional charges or high interest fees.\\n\\nWalmart already offers some financial services for customers. For example, it has Walmart MoneyCard, a prepaid debit card that customers can load with money and use for purchases. The card has some features that encourage money management or help people who may have a challenged credit history, such as no overdraft fees, no monthly fee and no minimum balance requirement.\\n\\nThe retailer also offers alternative payment plans for customers on a tight budget, such as layaway and Affirm, a fintech company that allows customers to buy an online item immediately and pay in installments.\\n\\nWalmart's co-owner of the new company, Ribbit Capital, has a history of investing in fintech companies. Its portfolio includes Affirm; Robinhood, a fee-free investing start-up; and Credit Karma, a company that offers consumer-friendly tools like free credit score checks.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Recently, it’s become popular to downplay the differences between B2B and B2C marketing. Some industry analysts and commentators have forcefully argued that all marketing should be viewed as “business-to-human,” “human-to-human,” or something similar.\\n\\nIt’s certainly accurate to say that virtually all forms of marketing involve the communication of messages to human beings. It’s equally true that business decision makers are also consumers, and that the attributes and preferences they have as consumers don’t evaporate when they’re acting in a professional capacity. But have all the meaningful differences between B2B and B2C marketing really disappeared?\\n\\nThe findings in two recent research reports – one by Marketo (now part of Adobe), and one by Forrester Consulting (commissioned by Adobe) – suggest that some of the lines between B2B and B2C marketing have become blurred. These two studies used different research approaches, and they emphasize different aspects of B2B and B2C marketing, but both raise issues that merit consideration.\\n\\nThe Marketo Study For this study, Marketo partnered with Loudhouse, an independent research firm, to survey 910 B2B buyers and interview 305 B2B marketing professionals. All of the study participants were located in the UK, Germany, or France, and the surveyed buyers represented a range of company sizes and job functions, including IT, Finance, HR, and Operations.\\n\\nThe survey found that, like consumers, B2B buyers are very concerned about privacy. More than 80% of the survey respondents said it is important for their prospective vendors to be serious about protecting their business and personal data and to always conform to best practices for handling their data and sensitive information.\\n\\nMarketo’s survey also found that many B2B buyers, like many consumers, are placing importance on the social values and practices of the companies they do business with. The following table shows the percentage of buyer survey respondents who rated six social practices as important:\\n\\nThis study also revealed two other emerging similarities between business buyers and consumers. First, 30% of the surveyed buyers said they would disengage from a vendor whose values don’t match their own. And second, it appears that B2B buyers, like consumers, are becoming less loyal. Forty-three percent of the surveyed buyers said they are always looking for a better deal.\\n\\nThe Forrester Consulting Study The principal objective of the Forrester Consulting study was to explore the similarities between business and consumer purchase journeys. For this research, Forrester surveyed 552 B2B and B2C marketers (manager level and above) representing a wide range of industries and company sizes. Survey respondents were drawn from a total of nine countries. Because of the composition of the survey panel, this research actually captures the perceptions of marketing professionals regarding the convergence of business and consumer buying behaviors.\\n\\nIn the Forrester survey, marketers identified three attitudes or behaviors that business buyers and consumers share:\\n\\nMore specifically, Forrester asked marketers how certain elements of their customers’ buying journey have changed over the past two years. The following table shows the percentage of B2B and B2C marketers who reported that these journey attributes had increased significantly or somewhat:\\n\\nThere is little doubt that the expectations and behaviors of business buyers are being influenced by their experiences as consumers. But this doesn’t mean that all meaningful differences between B2B and B2C marketing have disappeared.\\n\\nMost B2C marketing still involves the communication of relatively simple messages to a large or very large audience. Most B2B marketing, on the other hand, still involves the communication of more complex messages to a relatively small audience. This difference alone requires the use of different marketing strategies, channels, and tactics.\\n\\nTop image courtesy of George Redgrave via Flickr CC.</td>\n",

Connect.IQ evaluates the digital performance of global businesses against 300 criteria that covers content, user experience and technical implementation including organic and paid search visibility and social presence.\\n\\nThrough the lens of Investis Digital\\'s Connected Content approach, which helps companies tell their brand stories through strategic and engaging content, build and run intelligent websites and reach audiences with powerful performance marketing solutions, this report ranks companies across five areas; narrative (our company, sustainability, reputation, investors, media and job seekers), content mix, channel mix, optimization and amplification.\\n\\nBringing 20 years of experience, Investis Digital has analyzed corporate websites across major indexes like FTSE, NYSE, and NASDAQ. In this report, it highlights companies in the NASDAQ and NYSE Top 100 to assess how effective they are at telling their stories through their corporate website and owned channels.\\n\\nNotably, the report shows:\\n\\nWhile sustainability is high on both the corporate and societal agenda, less than 10 percent of companies in this group explain their sustainability strategy. (NASDAQ 100) 54 percent of companies have seen a 2-year increase in organic keywords, but only 34 percent of them rank for more non-branded, industry keywords than their brand and company name. (NYSE 100)\\n\\nProminently ranked as Connect.IQ\\'s NASDAQ 100 leader is Exelon, the nation\\'s leading competitive energy provider who successfully maintains an effective narrative on their corporate website, which includes highlighting its focus on sustainability through its corporate environment policy. Other leaders include:\\n\\nConnect.IQ NASDAQ Leaders\\n\\n1 Exelon\\n\\n2 Intel\\n\\n3 Amazon\\n\\n4 ADP\\n\\n5 Analog Devices\\n\\nConnect.IQ NYSE Leaders\\n\\n1 Merck & Co.\\n\\n2 Lockheed Martin\\n\\n3 Accenture\\n\\n4 CVS Health\\n\\n5 UPS\\n\\nDon Scales, Global CEO of Investis Digital, said, \"This report is an excellent showcase of how companies must completely rethink their communications and marketing strategies in today\\'s digital-first world. You must have soundproof websites, digital estates and omni-channel performance marketing strategies that reach your most important audiences. This is especially true if you hope to remain relevant to a new generation of job seekers, customers who put purpose over profit and investors who are expected to focus on the harder elements of reputation. That\\'s why our Connected Content approach is so powerful. It does just that.\"\\n\\nAccording to the Connect.IQ NASDAQ 100 report, from investors to employees, \\'purpose\\' is increasingly driving the agenda but only 25 percent of companies in this group share theirs.\\n\\n\"Companies need to provide a more consistent and coherent perspective of what they do, focus more on stakeholder value, and show long-term business sustainability.

This should be refined with three perspectives or lenses: zoom (existing customers, current products), wide (entire customer journey), and fisheye (changes in the periphery).\\n\\nTogether, these factors yield a 3X3 matrix to map a company\\'s performance in continuous customer innovation - from incremental to breakthrough innovation, from an internal focus to an ecosystem strategy.\\n\\nProactive customer innovation yields more sustainable advantage than innovation only in products, operations and markets. This calls for relentless listening to customers and building new capacities internally and via external partnerships, the authors emphasise.\\n\\nAll three capabilities are needed together: focus only on connection will make the company a slave to the customer and miss emerging markets; not converting insights into action will be a waste of intelligence; and focusing only on radical innovation will miss the benefits of incremental innovation.\\n\\nCo-creation with customers helps increase likelihood of product success, ensure buy-in, spur referrals, and provide authentic credible testimonials. Barriers to a customer-centric view include \"blind love\" for current products, and skepticism that customers have value to add, the authors caution.\\n\\nContinuous feedback loops and immersion in customer lives helps understand their needs better. Customers should also be harnessed as sources of ideas and even developers of their own solutions, the authors advise.\\n\\nPeriodic surveys and continuous social media communication help a company stay connected to its customers. Ethnographic approaches to observation yield deeper insights into unarticulated needs and emotional benefits. Customer communities, smart devices, and idea-sharing platforms are useful approaches in this regard.\\n\\nExamples include Zappos\\' call centres, Intel\\'s digital anthropologists, Coca-Cola\\'s Freestyle dispensers, Granville\\'s bicycle configurators, Televic\\'s simulated patient rooms, MyStarbucks idea platform, and Maker Faires.\\n\\nThese insights can then be converted into incremental innovations through daily improvements and small-step changes. Care should be taken to avoid feature bloat and meaningless differentiation, the authors caution.\\n\\nInstead, connected development should be adopted in an open and iterative manner, and customers should be shown that their suggestions matter, are listened to, and acted upon. The entire organisation will need to be engaged in such responsibilities.\\n\\nExamples include Lego Ideas, Asos Style Match, and Chateauform\\'s event surveys, annual idea fairs, and customer advisory board.\\n\\nThe next step of maturity in this perspective is to collaborate with customers as advocates, guides, advisors, idea screeners, designers, influencers, and even as employees.\\n\\n\"Start seeing customers as key collaborators. Build a structured collaboration with customers by giving them an active role,\" the authors advise. Customers should be treated as more than just buyers. Separately, enterprise or internal crowdfunding can spur ideas from within the organisation.\\n\\nExamples include Zipcar\\'s customer communities, IBM Innovation Jams, Local Motor\\'s customer created cars, and Salesforce.com\\'s annual Dreamforce event and Most Valuable Player customer ambassador programme.\\n\\nThe wide lens perspective focuses not just on current products and their functional benefits, but on expanded opportunities by addressing the entire customer journey, needs, and aspirations.\\n\\nExamples include Airnbnb storyboarding, Engie energy calculation tool for switching costs, BMW\\'s five-year guarantee, OTIS predictive maintenance, Van de Welde 3D digital mirrors for size estimates, and Zagat\\'s restaurant ratings.\\n\\nOther connect examples are Orica\\'s explosives estimates, Dow Corning Xiameter\\'s targeting of the price-seeker segment, Spotify\\'s music discovery, PatientsLikeMe community, and the Disneyland journey where excitement begins with ticket purchase even before the park visit.\\n\\nThese insights can be further converted into business models for offering integrated solutions, beyond products and services. The focus shifts from transactions to customer relationships, but calls for acquiring new competencies in segmentation and pricing, the authors explain.\\n\\nExamples include Betafence security systems, Amazon Kindle, Kiehl\\'s subscription cosmetics, Tide\\'s drive-through drycleaning, WeWork co-working spaces, and the product-to-service transitions of IBM. GE, and Rolls-Royce.\\n\\nThe final maturity stage in this evolution is collaborating along the entire value chain. An \"asset cocktail\" should be created with partners, or by acquisition, the authors evocatively explain.\\n\\nExamples here include Barry Callebaut\\'s cocoa bean certifications for fair trade, Carglass customer reports for insurance brokers, Ahold Delhaize\\'s local products retail, MyJohnDeere connected big data platform, the Netflix combination of large catalogue and recommendation engine, and smartphone app platforms.\\n\\nIn addition to customer journeys of today, companies need to cultivate peripheral vision and spot weak or distant signals in the environment. It is important to focus not just on the valuable customers of today, but on emerging segments and latent needs, the authors emphasise.\\n\\nRoadblocks here include confirmation bias with current customers, mental models of the dominant logic, the curse of prior knowledge, risk aversion, and even the \\'boiling frog\\' trap. Tools like active scanning, scenario planning, reverse mentoring, and probe-and-learn experiments can help here.\\n\\nConnection examples include Airbnb\\'s spotting of the shared stay market, JustPark\\'s crowdfunding campaign, Nestle shielding and spinning of Nespresso, and the rise of low-cost airlines.\\n\\nConverting these insights into business advantage calls for business model innovation through an exploratory mindset and strategic experiments. New ventures can be spun off, but should benefit from the parent\\'s assets. Obstacles to overcome are fear of cannibalisation, inertia, sunken cost fallacy, resource lockage, turf battles, scepticism, and even self-sabotage.\\n\\nSuccessful examples here include the rise of Salesforce.com, Amazon\\'s wave of experiments, Disney\\'s business expansion, and Netflix\\'s business models of DVD rentals, streaming, and content creation.\\n\\nNimble players with value-added products such as Starbucks and Chobani have outflanked commodity dairy milk producers. The responses of incumbents like Kodak and Blockbuster to disruptors was too little and too late, the authors observe.\\n\\nThe final stage of fisheye lens excellence is collaboration via adaptable ecosystems. Key success factors are nimble orchestration of ecosystems by finding complementary capabilities, resources and knowledge - from suppliers, partners, and even competitors.\\n\\nExamples include Janssen Pharmaceuticals\\' Venture and Incubation Centre to attract entrepreneurs, and focus on patient-centric disease management systems instead of just product pipelines. An incubated project was the Healseeker computer game for ADHD patients. (See also YourStory\\'s Startup Hatch series of corporate accelerator and incubator profiles.)\\n\\nOther ecosystem examples are the Cisco Hyper Innovation Living Labs (CHILLs) and the YardClub construction marketplace (acquired by Caterpillar). Managing ecosystems can be tricky, as IBM found early in the PC business when it ended up giving power away to Microsoft and Intel.\\n\\nIn sum, companies need to combine customer innovation perspectives from all three lenses - zoom, wide, and fisheye. They need to defend the current market position and add value through integration skills - while also placing selected bets on the future and building ecosystem mastery.\\n\\n\"The ability to innovate your company around the customer is a constant source of competitive advantage.

Tools like active scanning, scenario planning, reverse mentoring, and probe-and-learn experiments can help here.\\n\\nConnection examples include Airbnb\\'s spotting of the shared stay market, JustPark\\'s crowdfunding campaign, Nestle shielding and spinning of Nespresso, and the rise of low-cost airlines.\\n\\nConverting these insights into business advantage calls for business model innovation through an exploratory mindset and strategic experiments. New ventures can be spun off, but should benefit from the parent\\'s assets. Obstacles to overcome are fear of cannibalisation, inertia, sunken cost fallacy, resource lockage, turf battles, scepticism, and even self-sabotage.\\n\\nSuccessful examples here include the rise of Salesforce.com, Amazon\\'s wave of experiments, Disney\\'s business expansion, and Netflix\\'s business models of DVD rentals, streaming, and content creation.\\n\\nNimble players with value-added products such as Starbucks and Chobani have outflanked commodity dairy milk producers. The responses of incumbents like Kodak and Blockbuster to disruptors was too little and too late, the authors observe.\\n\\nThe final stage of fisheye lens excellence is collaboration via adaptable ecosystems. Key success factors are nimble orchestration of ecosystems by finding complementary capabilities, resources and knowledge - from suppliers, partners, and even competitors.\\n\\nExamples include Janssen Pharmaceuticals\\' Venture and Incubation Centre to attract entrepreneurs, and focus on patient-centric disease management systems instead of just product pipelines. An incubated project was the Healseeker computer game for ADHD patients. (See also YourStory\\'s Startup Hatch series of corporate accelerator and incubator profiles.)\\n\\nOther ecosystem examples are the Cisco Hyper Innovation Living Labs (CHILLs) and the YardClub construction marketplace (acquired by Caterpillar). Managing ecosystems can be tricky, as IBM found early in the PC business when it ended up giving power away to Microsoft and Intel.\\n\\nIn sum, companies need to combine customer innovation perspectives from all three lenses - zoom, wide, and fisheye. They need to defend the current market position and add value through integration skills - while also placing selected bets on the future and building ecosystem mastery.\\n\\n\"The ability to innovate your company around the customer is a constant source of competitive advantage. When it is embedded into the culture and processes, it becomes the driving force for any organisation to survive and thrive,\" the authors sign off.', 'Home\"5G\"ABB Power Grids to use 5G-ready Ericsson Industry Connect 5GConnectivityEnterpriseNewsSmart Factory ABB Power Grids to use 5G-ready Ericsson Industry Connect Juan Pedro Tomás 2020-04-23 Juan Pedro Tomás * April 23, 2020 * 25 Share 0 FacebookTwitterLinkedinemail\\n\\nEricsson has announced that ABB Power Grids will use the 5G-ready Ericsson Industry Connect system at its transformer factory in Ludvika in Sweden, in order to increase productivity and performance.\\n\\nThis is the first commercial application of the latest version of the system at a fully operating manufacturing plant.

(It expects to reach this goal for its U.S. operations by the end of this year.) This move could result in the equivalent of removing 2.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nMeanwhile, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca amped up its renewable energy with a deeper commitment to addressing industrial heat by joining the Renewable Thermal Collaborative, dedicated to decarbonizing tough-to-abate manufacturing and production processes. Currently, 13 percent of AstraZeneca’s power load comes from combined heat and power, and the company has committed to identifying renewable alternatives by 2025.\\n\\nTwo energy-centric campaigns managed by the Climate Group welcomed new members this week. The EP100 initiative, which encourages companies to commit to higher levels of productivity and revenue while using less energy, has more than 100 members, with Japan’s Daito Trust Construction among the latest joiners.

Share 0\\n\\nThe UK government has announced a further £28.3 million in joint public-private funding to support nine new 5G testbeds, as part of its £200 million campaign to leverage 5G to energise the UK industrial sector, and as it seeks to open up UK telecoms supply chains. The move follows\\n\\nThe new funding package comprises £15.2 million from the UK government and £13.1 million coming from project partners. It is the second funding round in the UK\\'s 5G Create programme, supported by the government\\'s Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS); the first round saw £30 million divided between six projects.\\n\\nIn total, the government has now funded 33 5G testbeds across the UK as part of its £200 million 5G Testbeds and Trials programme (5GTT), which 5G Create falls into, and 15 as part of the 5G Create programme. Five of the nine new projects stipulate usage of open RAN 5G networks.\\n\\nThe government said these open RAN networks allow for \"greater interoperability of radio equipment between vendors and give operators more choice and flexibility as they roll out 5G\". Open RAN is a key element of the government\\'s 5G \\'diversification strategy\\'.\\n\\nThe new round-two funding variously covers the tourism, sports, logistics, transport, creative, and construction industries; the announcement has run with a headline about UK naturalist David Attenborough, related to a 5G-enabled AR project that seeks to bring the \"wonders of the natural world\" to the people.\\n\\nHowever, of most interest to Enterprise IoT Insights, the new funding details a trio of projects dedicated to Industry 4.0. These include: the £5.3 million 5G Logistics initiative in Bristol, looking at asset tracking in port and warehouse environments; the £3.4 million 5G Ports project at the Port of Felixstowe, looking at remote-controlled cranes and crane maintenance; and the £1.7 million 5G AMC 2 project for the construction industry, taking place in Scotland, which seeks to make use of cameras, drones, and mixed reality for asset tracking and process optimisation.\\n\\nAll of these will leverage private 5G networks. The first and third use open RAN; the second, at the Port of Felixstowe, is being managed by Hutchison Ports, and engages mobile operator Three UK, also a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings.\\n\\nMatt Warman, minister for digital infrastructure, said: \"5G is about so much more than faster mobile internet speeds so we\\'re investing millions to help some of Britain\\'s brightest innovators explore the huge potential of the technology to improve and enrich our lives. The projects we\\'ve selected will demonstrate how the blistering speeds of 5G can put some rocket fuel in our economy and help businesses bounce back from the pandemic.\"\\n\\nFull detail of all nine projects is listed below.\\n\\n1 | Milton Keynes 5G (MK5G)\\n\\nTotal funding: £4,103,022\\n\\nGovernment funding: £2,397,243\\n\\nProject location: Milton Keynes, South East\\n\\nMilton Keynes Council will test out 5G applications at Stadium MK, home of football team MK Dons, to illustrate how it can \"empower\" other venues to boost efficiency and create better experiences. The trials will include using driverless shuttles and road vehicles for moving people and goods across the site, autonomous surveillance vehicles and drones for enhancing security, and testing out robots and drones for goods delivery and hospitality use.\\n\\nJohn Cove, director at MK Dons said: \"We have been able to bring together a world class team to integrate and exploit 5G capability in a dynamic real world environment - this will truly demonstrate how Stadium MK can use new technology to support a major international sporting and cultural venue.\"\\n\\n2 | Eden Universe (OpenRAN)\\n\\nTotal funding: £3,338,333\\n\\nGovernment funding: £1,662,881\\n\\nProject location: South Cornwall, South West\\n\\nThe Eden Project will explore how 5G and 360-degree video can enhance the visitor experience. Those who are unable to go to the Eden site in person will be able to experience the exhibits and talks from anywhere in the world via a desktop, mobile or virtual reality device and be taken on a real-time virtual reality tour. The local 5G infrastructure will also be used to provide real-time data on core services such as energy and water management.\\n\\nDan James, development director at the Eden Project, said: \"We are looking forward to testing just how 5G can help support our educational, arts, and community programmes, and provide new and exciting reasons for people to keep visiting us in person or virtually. The data collected through the 5G network will also help us manage the site and improve the visitor experience and our environmental performance.\"\\n\\n3 | Connected Cowes (OpenRAN)\\n\\nTotal funding: £1,654,389\\n\\nGovernment funding: £826,915\\n\\nProject location: Isle of Wight, South East\\n\\nThe Connected Cowes project is looking at how 5G can create an \"immersive yacht racing experience\" for the sailing community and spectators in Cowes and online. 5G will be used to stream VR video from yachts racing at events from Cowes. This will be used to create content and enable immersive teaching using 5G-powered VR.\\n\\nLaurence Mead, regatta director at Cowes Week, said: \"This funding is going to enable us to showcase world-beating, non-stadium sports coverage. Our event takes place over 20 square miles of water and will test 5G to the limit.\"\\n\\n4 | 5G AMC 2 (OpenRAN)\\n\\nTotal funding: £1,692,733\\n\\nGovernment funding: £846,365\\n\\nProject location: Shetland and Kilsyth, Scotland\\n\\n5G AMC 2 (Accelerate, Maximise and Create for Construction) will explore how 5G enables the use of data to maximise productivity of construction processes. The project will set up a private 5G network at construction firm BAM Nuttall\\'s regional office in Kilsyth, Scotland, and a construction project in Shetland.\\n\\nThe private 5G network will connect cameras, drones, mixed reality, and IoT sensors to monitor construction processes and track assets. The project will be an enabler for digital solutions that improve construction productivity for the wider UK construction industry. It will be delivered by a consortium led by BAM Nuttall partnered with AttoCore and Building Research Establishment.\\n\\nColin Evison, head of innovation at BAM Nuttall, said: \"The 5G Create... will help us in our mission to build sustainable environments that enhance people\\'s lives. The project outcomes will benefit our business and the wider construction industry in its drive to improve productivity.\"\\n\\n5 | Live and Wild: Filming with 5G (OpenRAN)\\n\\nTotal funding: £2,136,420\\n\\nGovernment funding: £1,224,834\\n\\nProject location: Leeds, North East\\n\\nLive & Wild: Filming with 5G will test 5G\\'s capacity to support the needs of the documentary film industry in the UK. Filming will take place in a variety of extreme locations and weather conditions across the UK designed to test 5G\\'s performance to its limit, including in caving, sea cliff climbing, and ultra-running.\\n\\nPatricia Doherty, project director at Candour TV, said: \"We are really looking forward to discovering the ways in which 5G can help us deliver fast-turnaround and live video content without compromising on high production values.
